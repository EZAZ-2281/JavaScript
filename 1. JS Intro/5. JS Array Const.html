5. JavaScript Array Const
It has become a common practice to declare arrays using const:
<body>
  <p id="gk"></p>
  <script>
    const car = ["Volvo", "Totota", "BMW"]; 
    document.getElementById("gk").innerHTML = car;  
  </script>
</body>
***
An array declared with const cannot be reassigned:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
***
Arrays are Not Constants
The keyword const is a little misleading.
It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.
Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.
***
Elements Can be Reassigned
You can change the elements of a constant array:
<body>
  <p id="gk"></p>
  <script>
    const car = ["Volvo", "Totota", "BMW"]; 
    car[0] = "Saab"; 
    car.push("Audi"); 
    document.getElementById("gk").innerHTML = car;  
  </script>
</body>
***
Assigned when Declared
JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
Meaning: An arrays declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.
const cars;
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];//error
But, 
var cars; 
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; //this is ok
***
Const Block Scope
An array declared with const has Block Scope.
An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block:
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
***
An array declared with var does not have block scope:
Example
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
{
  var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}
// Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
***
Redeclaring Arrays
Redeclaring an array declared with var is allowed anywhere in a program:
Example
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed
***
Redeclaring or reassigning an array to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:
Example
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
{
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
}
***
Redeclaring or reassigning an existing const array, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:
Example
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Not allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];         // Not allowed

{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
  cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];       // Not allowed
}
***
Redeclaring an array with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:
Example
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
