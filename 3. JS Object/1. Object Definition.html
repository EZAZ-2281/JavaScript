JavaScript Objects
In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.
***
JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.
JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).
***
Objects are Variables
It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
Example
<body>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p id="gk"></p>
    <script>
        const person = {
            fName: "Golam", 
            lName: "Kibria"
        }
        let a = document.getElementById("gk"); 
        a.innerHTML = person.fName+" "+person.lName; 
    </script>
</body>
The named values, in JavaScript objects, are called properties.
Property	
firstName
lastName

Creating a JavaScript Object
With JavaScript, you can define and create your own objects.
There are different ways to create new objects:
Create a single object, using an object literal.
Create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
Create an object using Object.create().
***
This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 2 properties:
<body>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p id="gk"></p>
    <script>
        const person = {}; 
        person.fName = "Golam"; 
        person.lName = "Kibria Ezaz"; 
        let a = document.getElementById("gk"); 
        a.innerHTML = person.fName+" "+person.lName; 
    </script>
</body>
***
Using the JavaScript Keyword new
The following example create a new JavaScript object using new Object(), and then adds 2 properties:
<body>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p id="gk"></p>
    <script>
        const person = new Object();  
        person.fName = "Golam"; 
        person.lName = "Kibria Ezaz"; 
        let a = document.getElementById("gk"); 
        a.innerHTML = person.fName+" "+person.lName; 
    </script>
</body>
The examples above do exactly the same.
But there is no need to use new Object().
For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.(মানে আগের পদ্বতি গুলো) 
***
JavaScript Objects are Mutable
Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:
const x = person;  // Will not create a copy of person.
The object x is not a copy of person. It is person. Both x and person are the same object.
Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object.
<body>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p id="gk"></p>
    <script>
        const person = {
            fName: "Abdur", 
            lName: "Rahim"
        }
        let x = person; 
        let a = document.getElementById("gk"); 
        a.innerHTML = x.fName+" "+x.lName; 
    </script>
</body>
